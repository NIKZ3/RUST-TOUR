1. object which is a vector of objects implementing trait Draw.
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>

2. Trait objects can be used for inheritance. where in you could have a struct with trait objects that implement particular trait so that can be used blindly by our implementation.

Generics Vs Trait Objects

3.  pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>> -> This allows you store any type that implements a certain trait. (Trait objects)
    pub components: Vec<T> -> This only allows single type either some struct or int etc. (Generics)
